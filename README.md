### Hey! 👋
I'm Simon, a high school student from Eastern MA! I like making projects for my school and community, so that's mostly what you'll find here :)

### Some highlights:

💻 [Secure electromagnetically locked boxes for borrowing chargers at my school's library](https://github.com/sjuknelis/chargerbox)

🏫 [React Native (Android) version of school student app to view schedule, athletics, lunch menu, directory, and more](https://github.com/sjuknelis/nobles-app-rn)
